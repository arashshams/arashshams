I am passionate about:

- 📊 Data Science
- 📐 Chemical Engineering
- 🎶 Music
- ⚽ Soccer

My quest is to create quality content in the first two fields on my Github and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arashshamseddini) pages 💪💪💪 🚀🚀🚀

As for the other two, I am not that confident, but I will be doing my best 🤞🤞🤞
